# dotfiles
my personal minimal dotfiles i would not recommend trying to use
# installing
to **install** these dotfiles first install these
```
waybar, hyprland, wofi, kitty, nautilus, firefox, grim
```
once **installed** u have to add the ✨*dotfiles*✨
to do that just move the files to the folders (or u cant do that)
if u cant do that just follow this
```
hypr to ~/.config/hypr/ and replace the folder for all of these
waybar to ~/.config/waybar/
wofi to ~/.config/wofi/
```
and boom ur done just restart hyprland and thats it keybinds below bellow belo whatever it is
# keybinds
exit = SUPER + M
kitty = SUPER + R
firefox = SUPER + W
nautilus = SUPER + F
wofi = SUPER + D
grim = SUPER + B
